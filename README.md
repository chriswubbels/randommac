# randommac

Version 0.1 - Tested on macOS 12.2.1 - 2022-03-07

Generates a random MAC address, disconnects from any Wi-Fi networks, and sets the Wi-Fi interface to use the random address.

## Notes:

- Does nothing to examine whether the MAC address is unicast, multicast, etc. YMMV
- Does not reconnect to the Wi-Fi network. You need to do that manually in the usual way.
